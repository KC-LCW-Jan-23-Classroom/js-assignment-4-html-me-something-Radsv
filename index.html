   <h2>Nafplion, Greece</h2> 

   <P class="funParagraph" id="testP"> 

      Nafplio  is a coastal city located in the Peloponnese in Greece and it is the capital of the regional unit of Argolis and  

      an important touristic destination. Founded in antiquity, the city became an important seaport in the Middle Ages during 

       the Frankokratia as part of the lordship of Argos and Nauplia, held initially by the de la Roche following the Fourth  

       Crusade before coming under the Republic of Venice and, lastly, the Ottoman Empire. The city was the second capital of  

       the First Hellenic Republic and of the Kingdom of Greece, from 1827 until 1834.

   <h2>Athens, Greece</h2> 

   <p> 

      Athens, with its tall buildings and contemporary shops, is the first European city when approached from the Middle East.  

      When approached from the west, from elsewhere in Europe, what strikes the visitor is the influence of the East—in the food, 

       music, and clamorous street life—perhaps vestiges of a time when Athens was divorced from European society under the yoke of  

       Ottoman rule. Nevertheless, it is wrong to say that Athens is a mixture of East and West: it is Greek and, more particularly, 

        Athenian. The city, after all, nurtured Western civilization thousands of years ago. Athens remains on the world stage to  

        this day.

   <h2>Santorini, Greece</h2> 

   <p> 

      Santorini, known since ancient times as Thira, is one of the most famous islands in the world. 

       The fact that you can sit in front of the caldera, enjoy local dishes, a drink or a coffee while 

        gazing at the remarkable beauty of an active volcano is priceless! 

 
 

      The island is actually a group of islands consisting of Thira, Thirassia, Aspronissi, Palea and Nea Kameni 

       in the southernmost part of the Cyclades. 

       

      Santorini’s volcano is one of the few active volcanoes on Greek and European land The islands that form  

      Santorini came into existence as a result of intensive volcanic activity; twelve huge eruptions occurred, 

       one every 20,000 years approximately, and each violent eruption caused the collapse of the volcano’s  

       central part creating a large crater (caldera). The volcano, however, managed to recreate itself over and over again.

   <h2>Crete, Greece</h2> 

   <p> 

      The largest island in Greece, Crete is renowned for its pin-up beaches, wild natural beauty, exquisite cuisine and thousands 

       of years of culture and history 

      As Crete’s most celebrated author, Nikos Kazantzakis (of Zorba the Greek fame), once wrote: “The mystery of Crete runs deep. 

       Whoever sets foot on this island senses a mysterious force coursing warmly and beneficently through their veins, sensing their 

        soul beginning to grow.”  

       

      Unsurprisingly, this mystical, pure and generous island to the south of the Aegean Sea captures the spirit of Greece and  

      enchants everyone who visits.  

       

      Heraklion, Rethymno, Chania, Agios Nikolaos, Elounda, Ierapetra, Malia, Hersonissos, Sitia, Sfakia… wherever you visit, 

       it’s an island of thousands of vibrant images, filled with an open-hearted and vivacious spirit, rich history, world-famous 

        cuisine and hospitable people.

      <h4>Dolmadakia</h4> 

      <p>This is another sign of the versatile nature of Greek food. Dolmadakia are tiny dolmades that are made of  

         stuffed grape leaves. Inside the leaf you will get meat of ground lamb or beef (sometimes both) and rice stuffing. 

          Traditionally, this dish is served as appetizer with lemon wedges.</p>

      <h4>Baklava</h4> 

      <p>Baklava is the quintessential Greek food experience. This cuisine mostly contains nuts and butter along with sugar.  

         After baking, sweet syrup is poured over it so that the syrup can be absorbed by the crispy layers of phyllo. 

          It is probably the most popular food item among all Greek desserts. It brings a festive mood in the dining room through  

          its exquisite flavor and flaky crust.</p>
